# Memetic Evolution Simulation

## Overview
The Memetic Evolution Simulation is an interactive web-based project that explores the concepts of cultural and memetic evolution through a grid-based environment. Users can select agents that entertain through various creative means, interact with each other, and evolve based on user preferences.

## Features
- **3x3 Grid Layout**: The simulation is structured in a 3x3 grid where each cell represents an agent.
- **Agent Interaction**: Agents can interact with one another, generating unique entertainment content.
- **User Preferences**: Users can influence the evolution of agents based on their preferences and selections.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Agents evolve over time, adapting their behaviors and content based on user feedback.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Isotus/memetic-evolution-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd memetic-evolution-simulation
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Simulation
To start the simulation, open the `src/index.html` file in your web browser. You can interact with the agents and observe their evolution based on your selections.

## Project Structure
- `src/index.html`: Main HTML document for the simulation.
- `src/styles/main.css`: Styles for the simulation layout and animations.
- `src/scripts/app.js`: Entry point for the JavaScript code managing the simulation flow.
- `src/scripts/agent.js`: Defines the Agent class and its behaviors.
- `src/scripts/grid.js`: Manages the 3x3 grid layout and agent placement.
- `src/scripts/evolution.js`: Contains the logic for the evolutionary process of agents.
- `src/assets/icons`: Directory for icons and images used in the simulation.
